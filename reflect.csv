Anushri,"*Reflection*  I’ve often approached communication in a transactional way, delivering information without considering its broader impact or tailoring it to different audiences. For example, when explaining processes, I used to focus solely on accuracy rather than ensuring the message was meaningful to diverse stakeholders. This document helped me understand that effective communication isn’t just about conveying facts but about creating value and driving action. For utilizing prompts for the same purpose, I need to work on how to refine my prompts to attain conversational intelligence.One key takeaway is the importance of shifting from providing answers to asking better questions. questioning how my prompts or solutions might resonate with clients from varied cultural or professional backgrounds. Application of structured frameworks like the Minto Pyramid Principle will ensure my communication is clear, purposeful, and aligned with business outcomes. For instance, when drafting case studies, I’ll begin with the end goal in mind, guiding the conversation towards meaningful insights by structuring my questions in a way that leads to clarity and purposeful action.  Another area I want to improve is seeking feedback more actively. sharing my drafts or prompts before they are tagged “perfect” by me so that early feedback can sharpen my thinking and make my prompts more effective. Incorporating peer reviews and mentorship into my workflow, using prompts to gather diverse perspectives and refine my communication.  To track my growth, I’ll create a personal checklist for every major piece of communication or prompt:  Have I identified the audience’s needs?  Am I addressing the “why” and “so what”?  Does the prompt drive a clear action or decision? Implementing methods like A/B testing for prompts, varying the tone, structure, or focus to see what sparks better engagement. This will help me build a data-driven understanding of effective prompting across diverse contexts.  The concept of thinking about the thinking process helps refine prompts for better clarity and impact. Taking a deep dive to build and cultivate cognitive flexibility will help me attain the desried or maybe an unexpected result that is even better than I imagined.  Prompt refinement is more than just polishing words, it’s about shifting perspectives. Prompting also represents the state of your mind and your cognitive abilities, so each prompt that is not good enough is actually our thought process that needs refinement. Moreover, this refinement mirrors the company’s values of clarity, inclusivity, and collective growth."
Ovi Santhe,"25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting Document  Ovi Santhe  Whilst engaging with this document, I gleaned some important applicable insights that can be implemented in my prompt engineering. It’s even inspiring me to conjure up a framework that can be ammended to every iteration of a prompt so that I don’t forget about the important improvements like ensuring to broaden my perspective and applying systems thinking to a project so that I’m thinking about it end to end. Similarly, incorporating depth into my engineering will ensure I cover all my bases, so that I get a rich and informative response from the AI. Rigorous inquiry is an important base to cover because it reflects strategic influence, and if done properly this will impact organisations and clients in a holistic and positive way.  Naturally, this is a method that relies heavily on the engineer; the outputs are only as smart and as thorough as the inputs - therefore we must imbibe ourselves with knowledge, concepts, competence, and pedagogy to provide rich fodder for the AI. It’s not enough to rely on AI to do all the donkey work; we must be agile and strategic inquisitor, with enough rigor and relevance, we can develop our critical and reflective thinking to provide optimizations for the AI to produce better results. We can implement frameworks and mental models that will ensure we are being thorough and consultive in our prompting. Still another important cornerstone of this continuous learning practice is to share our findings, to engage with the culture of open-mindedness and having an affinity for failure recovery so that we can receive feedback, reflect on our experiences, and improve our processes."
Dayita Deb,"*Reflection* on Better Prompting  While going through the document, I realized the importance of proactive exploration- asking the 'why' and 'how' of the process, so as to get an in-depth knowledge of the business culture. Underutilizing inquiry- not going into deeper tangents- can limit the depth of understanding. Staying on the surface level alludes lack of confidence and belief in the system. Rather we should focus on exploring every minute detail to gain richer insights. Consultants are adaptive and interactive to the global environment. Their responses exudes both the team expertise and organization value.  In order to develop a 'consultant mind', one should focus on the 'why' and 'how', growing an adaptive and result-oriented mind, and using structured frameworks of thinking and communication. While providing prompts- start with the conclusion or recommended action, providing arguments for the action, backing the arguments with data- this is to get to the point quickly while keeping it informative and filled with details about the project. How to accelerate our learning curve-- the practice of self-reflection and feedback- ask the AI if the actions or tones are appropriate for a specific context, asking for feedback on improvement, discussing with our peers or seniors about mistakes, in order to learn from them and broaden the perspective. Lastly, consulting mindset is a continuous process, and exploration of different organizational cultures is our stepping stones. Every outcome- positive or negative- is a learning opportunity for us."
Mehak Gupta,"25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting  I've been refining how I craft prompts by being more intentional about defining desired outcomes. But I've realized that my thinking often stays too narrow because I haven't exposed myself to enough diverse perspectives. This limits my ability to ask truly insightful questions. The document made me realize several blind spots: focusing only on immediate tasks rather than broader impact, taking a transactional approach instead of being consultative, and not asking enough probing questions. As said 'AI will not  replace the jobs, but the one's who know how to use AI effectively will replace the jobs' so it totally depends upon the user how effectively they prompt the AI and the kind of results they get. These gaps matter because in consulting, they directly affect how clients view our expertise and the strategic value we bring.  To grow, I'm committing to three things: First, expanding my horizons through case studies and observing how leaders communicate complex ideas. Second, challenging myself to always ask ""Why?"" to get to the heart of issues. And third, using frameworks to structure my thinking more effectively, while actively seeking feedback to keep improving. This isn't just about better prompts - it's about developing the kind of strategic mindset that creates real impact for our team and clients.  Structured thinking frameworks like the Minto Pyramid Principle can help in organizing thoughts logically and effectively."
Raghuveer Issar,"25/03/2025 *Reflection on Better Prompting*  Raghuveer Issar ~ Engaging with the document ""Better Prompting"" has provided me with valuable insights that are essential for enhancing my approach in attaining high-level consultant’s mindset.  When I talk about “Understanding the Importance of Perspective” One of the key takeaways from the document is the need to broaden my perspective beyond immediate tasks, now that I think about it, my daily practice in this regard is to relate an instance with various elements following the System Thinking, but I feel that I shall expand my horizon when it comes to the lens through which I look a particular deliverable as. It’s essential to consider the broader implications of my work, especially how it resonates with diverse elements of the ecosystem I reside in as this holistic view is crucial for effective consulting, as it allows me to fine tune my approach to prompt various ideas effectively.  Now that I think about this, as I have worked on creating the Custom GPT, for the purpose creating Briefs of various sessions and, by leveraging the role playing of Bain Consultants, it is crucial to point out that it followed a structure wherein, the purpose, objective, along with the personas, and input data as well was defined along with the steps, making sure that it is well versed with the reason behind its existence and the purpose of its outcomes along with the nature of the affected party for the same. I am then confident to same that by doing so I have attained the desired output.  And as the distinction between transactional and consultative communication was mentioned, it reminded me of my role that is not to just deliver information or give out instructions to my team or so, it is to engage with them in a holistic manner, by understanding where they are coming from and why. Moving forward I have myself realized that when I understand the reason behind anything I am then able to move beyond the surface level capability of solving a problem, like for example the problem statement of making Organic Content within 10 hours for the whole week. The practice of asking “why” and “so what can we do next” is something I shall incorporate more in my vocabulary.  Lastly the frameworks mentioned in the document, that is, MECE and Minto Pyramid Principle is something I can first gain foundational level understanding of before its implementation in organizing my thought process and enhancing clarity in my communication style. <This message was edited>"
Prameela Lalam,"25/03/2025 Reflection Prameela Lalam  Reading this document made me realize that consulting is not just about completing tasks but about thinking ahead and adding value. I often focus on providing direct answers, but I now see the importance of structuring my responses in a way that guides discussions and helps others make decisions. Instead of just giving information, I need to ask myself, “Why does this matter?” and “What should happen next?” This shift from a transactional to a consultative approach will make my communication more effective.  I also understand that learning from different industries and cultures can help me improve. Exposure to global case studies and different perspectives will allow me to think beyond my immediate tasks. Seeking feedback from experienced professionals and being open to learning will also help me refine my approach. Another key takeaway is the importance of being proactive—anticipating needs instead of just responding when required.  Moving forward, I want to focus on making my responses clearer, more structured, and more strategic. I will start checking if my communication considers the audience’s needs, explains the purpose, and provides a clear next step. By making these small changes, I can develop a better consulting mindset and add more value to my work."
Nandita Jha,"25/03/2025- Reflection on Better Prompting  ( By Nandita Jha)  After going through the document, I realized that our approach has been more task oriented rather than strategic. A consultant’s role should not just be to provide information but to think ahead and consider the bigger picture. So, we need to improve on key areas like being more consultative, thinking globally, and structuring our responses better. This shift will not only improve our communication but also enhance how we build trust and credibility with clients and stakeholders.  Instead of just explaining our process, we should reflect on why and how things work, why something matters to the business, and at what level it affects different audiences. We should also consider how to tailor our responses to different cultural contexts. To achieve this, we need to ask more questions to gain a deeper understanding.  Additionally, we should seek feedback from seniors and peers by actively asking for input on our communication style. Engaging in more case studies will also help improve cultural awareness.  This document has given us a clear roadmap for improvement,not just in writing but in developing a globally strategic and aware mindset. This way, our responses will be more insightful and aligned with the broader goals of the organization."
Faiza Mehak,"25/03/2025  *Reflection on better prompting*  Faiza ~ I went through the document and learned that I have always wanted immediate results. I never understood the clearer, bigger picture. Wanting immediate results decreased the quality of my work. Immediate tasks will give me results, but with a lot of brainstorming and prompting.  My tone with ChatGPT has also never been formal; it's just me thinking out loud. However, I need to adopt a formal, consultative approach. All the replies I give to ChatGPT’s questions are always minimal—sometimes just “yes” or “no.” I don’t check whether ChatGPT has understood the situation and the background by asking questions. I need to practice my critical questioning skills.  These gaps shouldn’t be there because I would be representing the organization, and having such minimal or naive thinking would directly affect the whole team as well.  I will now take the initiative to read at least one thread that Tarun has worked on to get familiar with the words that can be used as well as the structure of the prompts. I will constantly ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of what I’m working on. I will also research frameworks like the Minto Pyramid Principle and MECE to organize my thoughts.  Regular reviews of my prompts or chat threads will be part of my fixed routine from now on. No matter what work I do or what mistakes I make, I need to learn from them and maintain a growth mindset.  I need exposure to structured thinking and a consultative mindset. Learning from different industries, going through case studies, and actively seeking reviews of my work will help me improve. <This message was edited>"
Disha Bhandari,"*Reflection* on better prompting   I learned the critical importance of crafting precise and effective prompts to achieve meaningful outcomes, especially when interacting with AI systems. Better prompting requires a consultative mindset—thinking strategically about the purpose of each prompt, the audience it serves, and the desired result. By asking deeper questions like ""Why does this matter?"" and ""What should happen next?"" I can guide AI responses to align more closely with specific goals and anticipate broader implications.  The content emphasized that structured thinking frameworks such as the Minto Pyramid Principle or MECE can help develop logical and clear prompts, ensuring that they resonate with the task’s strategic objectives. Additionally, practicing outcome-oriented communication—where each prompt is designed to lead to actionable insights—can elevate the relevance and utility of AI-generated outputs.  Exposing myself to diverse case studies and working across departments could provide the necessary context for framing better prompts, while peer feedback can refine and uncover areas for improvement. I also understood that reflecting critically on each interaction with AI—evaluating tone, clarity, and audience-specific nuances—can help me consistently create stronger prompts.  Adopting a growth mindset plays a key role in refining prompting skills. Viewing each interaction as a learning opportunity allows for experimentation and adaptation, resulting in more effective and globally relevant communication. This approach not only enhances the ability to extract useful insights from AI but also ensures that my outputs are consultative, strategic, and aligned with organizational values."
Shivam Swarnkar,"Reflection  Right now, my responses tend to be more focused on just answering questions rather than considering the bigger picture like how my answers impact clients, leadership, or global audiences.  One of the main takeaways is that I should move beyond a transactional approach and start thinking more consultatively. Instead of just providing information, I need to guide conversations, ask deeper questions, and anticipate what’s next. For example..rather than just explaining a process, I should think about why it matters, how different cultures might react to it, and what suggestions I can offer.  Another important point is exposure. I need to broaden my understanding by studying real-world case studies, learning from senior consultants, and paying attention to how different industries and cultures approach business. The more I see and experience, the better my ability to think critically and communicate effectively.  So is the need to surround myself with brilliant minds, even though vicariously thru books or interviews.  The suggestionslike using structured thinking frameworks, seeking mentorship, and reflecting on my work..are all practical steps I can take to improve. I also need to develop a habit of always asking,  “Why does this matter?”and “ What action should be taken next?” This will help me shift from just stating facts to making meaningful recommendations. <This message was edited>"
Simran Tiwari,"*25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting (Simran)*  Thinking about “better prompting” made me realize it’s like learning to speak a language that both humans and AI understand. When I first started, I’d ask AI simple questions and get basic answers. But now I see that how I ask matters just as much as what I ask. It’s not just about getting answers—it’s about sparking useful conversations.  One big lesson is that AI needs clear direction, almost like a friendly guide. If I’m vague, the results feel scattered. For example, instead of saying, “Help with marketing,” I learned to say, “Plan a week’s social media posts for a eco-friendly skincare brand, focusing on busy moms.” Adding details like the audience and purpose helps AI “get” what I need. It’s like giving someone a map instead of just saying, “Go somewhere nice.”  Another thing I noticed is that prompts work best when they’re flexible. Sometimes I start with a rough idea, see what the AI gives me, and then tweak my next question based on that. It’s like playing catch you throw an idea, see how it comes back, and adjust your next throw. This back-and-forth helps uncover ideas I might not have thought of alone. For instance, when planning a project timeline, asking follow-ups like, “What could go wrong here?” or “How would a small business handle this?” adds depth I’d miss otherwise.  I also realized that good prompting isn’t just about being smart—it’s about being curious. Asking “What if?” or “How else?” pushes me and the AI to think beyond the obvious. It’s easy to stick to what I know, but better results come when I step outside my comfort zone. Like using storytelling in prompts: “Imagine we’re explaining this strategy to a new intern how would we make it simple and exciting?” This shifts the AI’s tone and makes the output more relatable.  Lastly, patience is key. Not every prompt works perfectly on the first try, and that’s okay. Learning from mistakes like when the AI misunderstands a request helps me improve. Sharing tips with others or testing different approaches turns prompting into a teamwork exercise. The more I practice, the better I get at turning vague ideas into clear, actionable steps.  In the end, better prompting feels less like bossing around a tool and more like building a partnership. It’s about clarity, creativity, and staying open to surprises. And when it clicks, it’s amazing how much smoother and smarter the work becomes."
Yukta Kabra,"25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting  Initially, my approach to prompting was somewhat limited in scope. I frequently used negative prompting, focusing on what I didn’t want rather than what I actually sought. Additionally, I often adopted a transactional approach—treating prompting as a straightforward input-output mechanism rather than a dynamic interaction. This method led to precise but sometimes uninspiring responses, as it didn’t fully leverage the potential of AI’s reasoning and exploration capabilities. After going through the document, I realized that effective prompting is more than just structuring a question correctly—it involves a shift in mindset. The document emphasized approaches like open-ended exploration, iterative refinement, and considering the AI as a collaborative partner rather than a mere tool. One of the key takeaways for me is the importance of clarity and specificity. I now understand that vague prompts often lead to generic responses, whereas well-defined and context-rich queries generate more precise and useful insights. Moreover, I have learned that iterative refinement is key to effective prompting. The first version of a prompt may not always yield the best response, and rephrasing or tweaking the approach can lead to better results. I will try using different models and by using practical case studies and examples to craft more realistic and applicable prompts that bridge the gap between theory and practice."
Maryada Jain,"25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting 1. Understanding who, why and how - who I am communicating with, why I am communicating and what is the purpose, and how to communicate, what could be the strategic response. While communicating with business owners it’s important to understand their mindset, having clarity on the purpose of communicating with them and adapt to different business contexts. 2. Understanding how to guide the prompts and the output required can help in learning how to guide conversation in real life 3. Taking specific steps like reading case studies and watching senior consultants can help in developing a broader mindset. While talking to business owners, especially while i go through the growth introspection study call again, i get a feeling that if a had known certain concepts i could have framed better questions and this adapting in communication would be helpful in getting clarity and depth 4. I agree that every prompt, every email, every meeting can be a learning opportunity. For instance, while reaching out, I talked to a CA. while he agreed to receive questions, but i realised I can ask chat GPT to frame the questions related to his field. This made me realise that these questions are quite generic and can be tailored to different industries which would also help in framing better questions and insights on GIC. 5. Lastly, I read this concept that you can ask chat gpt to be a prompt engineer. I’ll try this method to first understand the approach of prompt engineers and how they optimise inputs to get desired output. 6. Key takeaways - Consulting isn’t just about having answers—it’s about framing problems and guiding decisions. The way I communicate reflects DT’s brand and credibility."
Roshni Chawla,"25/03/2025 Reflection Roshni Chawla  The document highlights key areas where my prompting approach can evolve from being transactional to consultative, aligning with my goal of mastering Socratic dialogue and case studies. To improve, I need to focus on three core aspects: **structured thinking, storytelling, and mindset-driven creativity.**  Instead of jumping directly to a question, I should first establish context and define a clear problem statement. Using frameworks will help me structure my prompts logically. By presenting challenges in a structured format, I can guide responses toward deeper reasoning rather than surface-level answers.  A key takeaway is that storytelling can transform how questions are framed. Instead of simply asking about financial concepts, I should build a narrative around real-world situations.  A strong consulting mindset means always asking *“Why does this matter?”* and *“What is the broader impact?”* Rather than seeking one-dimensional answers, I need to cultivate a habit of exploring multiple perspectives, considering cultural nuances, and aligning questions with strategic goals. Creative questioning can also push boundaries—asking *“How would this concept fail?”* or *“What if this principle were applied in a completely different industry?”* can lead to innovative insights. To improve, I need to review my prompts regularly, ensuring they are **thought-provoking, structured, and engaging.** Seeking feedback from peers, analyzing case studies, and applying consulting frameworks will help me refine my approach. Every interaction—whether through a project, discussion, or written prompt—is an opportunity to enhance my skills in structured questioning, storytelling, and creative problem-solving.  By integrating structured thinking, storytelling, and a strategic mindset into my prompts, I can elevate my approach beyond simple questioning and turn it into a tool for deeper exploration, analysis, and engagement."
Megha Karmakar,"*25/03/25 Reflection on Better Prompting:*  The document “Better Mindset, Better Prompting” provided me with valuable insights into how a broader, more in-depth approach to thinking can lead to better understanding and application of concepts. One of the key takeaways was that it is never ideal to have a narrowly focused or streamlined thought process when tackling a problem. Instead, developing a deeper and more expansive understanding of a subject allows for better comprehension and, more importantly, more effective application in real-world scenarios. Several factors hinder the development of this expansive mindset. The first is the tendency to seek immediate solutions rather than delving into the why behind a problem. Often, people focus solely on solving the issue at hand without fully grasping the underlying causes, which can lead to superficial solutions rather than long-term understanding. Secondly, when working with AI, there is a common habit of providing surface-level explanations instead of conveying the complete essence of an idea. This limited approach can restrict AI’s ability to generate meaningful and insightful responses. Lastly, a lack of curiosity about the fundamental principles behind a topic prevents individuals from acquiring deep, foundational knowledge. These deficiencies can have a significant impact, especially for clients and stakeholders. When ideas are not deeply understood from their core, it becomes evident in the execution, increasing the likelihood of future complications. A shallow grasp of a concept can lead to inconsistent results, misunderstandings, and even the failure of a project. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to develop an insatiable hunger for knowledge—one that seeks not just solutions but the very roots of a concept. Cultivating curiosity and a willingness to explore beyond immediate concerns is key. Additionally, proper mentorship and structured guidance play a vital role in shaping a mindset that values depth over superficiality. Surrounding oneself with the right influences and learning from experienced individuals can accelerate this growth. Moreover, embracing open-mindedness and cross-disciplinary collaboration adds immense value. Engaging with different fields, working on entirely new problems, and exposing oneself to diverse perspectives can significantly enhance problem-solving skills. The ability to shift focus, adapt to new challenges, and remain receptive to unfamiliar ideas ultimately fosters a more innovative and well-rounded mindset. By actively nurturing these qualities, one can move beyond surface-level understanding and develop a mindset that not only excels in problem-solving but also drives meaningful innovation and long-term success."
Paridhi Gupta,"*Reflection 25/03/2025* 1. While working with AI platforms and prompting, we often tend to do it in a rush to get the ""job done"". This leads to superficial and vague prompts. While it provides an output, the chances of it not meeting the right standards and of being disconnected to the real stakeholders are much higher.  2. As interns, another major mistake we often make is not questioning the existing processes and not trying to understand the reasoning behind them better. This stops us from making necessary adaptations as well. For example, over the last few weeks we were making cold calls because that is what we had started with. Despite seeing lack of results, we did not stop to consider why we were using this approach and what could be changed.  3. While prompting, it's also important to keep in mind that the AI platform is as good as the prompts. If we don't have enough clarity on what we are trying to achieve, it'll make us dependent on the AI tool and unable to evaluate the quality of responses. Guiding the conversation requires having a clear process and end goal in mind.  4. A lot of the projects we are working on are complex in nature, with no available precedent. In such projects, going in with assumptions can be costly. It's always a good idea to spend some time digging deeper, trying to identify what other approaches can be used and then converging onto one (divergent and convergent thinking).  5. When responding to AI responses/questions, the goal is to keep the discussion going towards the desired goal. This requires not just answering questions, but using those answers to build upon the process and the plan. For eg - when GPT asks about target audience, simply naming the audience won't help as much as going into depth and clarifying the persona of that audience will.  6. The way we communicate shapes the way we prompt, and when representing an organization and being in a client-facing role, it becomes essential to be clear and strategic in one's communication. Yesterday while talking to a business owner I realised that I would want to become better at quickly adapting my conversation based on their business context, instead of trying to engage them in a pre planned conversation. Similarly, prompts need to adapt to the flow and goal of discussion as well.  7. To expand exposure, I am currently reading more books and trying to categorise assumptions vs facts. For example, we're still trying to figure out what messaging will grab attention of business owners, but we do know that calls are not working due to lack of their availability and difficulty in adapting the conversation in real time. Based on this, we're now going to try and experiment different messages.  8. While I've been setting clear expectations in my prompts, I would start challenging the responses more now with socratic questions of ""how and why"". Once the outcome is clear, I can then decide how to make it happen with the right workflows.  9. Another thing I want to do is spend one hour identifying the necessary frameworks and principles that I should keep handy while writing prompts."
Alatinanda,"Better Prompting - Reflection Alatinanda 25/03/2025  Focusing on immediate tasks rather than real world audiences, responding to prompts in a straightforward, minimal way - are some of the aforementioned points that I'm guilty of indulging ever so often that I use ChatGPT, let's say, AI in general. As long as a satisfying result - in my terms - is rendered from the task in hand, that was alright. But reading the prompts shared, and how such a big difference strikes between before and after the thorough prompting I wonder how far I was able to utilize the full potential of something this cool in my reach. Better prompting not only meaning better input equals better output, but how that better output is also presenting a brand in front of a real world audience. Asking 'why' and 'so what' is definitely something I'd like to inculcate in my working process from here on, and going into depths of what exactly I'd be liking to achieve through that. This also highlights how having deeper knowledge of related topics also brings forth that in our thought process while getting a clear result, providing us with better insights to the vague responds because at the end of the day, AI is but a tool, which is required to be used in a manner so that we receive the result we seek, just like how for any other tool before we start utilizing it entirely there's a learning curve."
Dalia Singh,"25/03/2025 Reflection on better prompts.  Using gen AI to get work done or answer queries is what we all have done tille now. But learning the core to make AI think as we want it to, is new.  Mastering the prompts can be done through expanding our knowledge base, through being more aware by increasing our exposure. This can be done via workshops, reading and watching thought leader interviews.  Secondly, by asking questions, reflecting and critically thinking about our prompts can help us refine them. And adding on to it peer review can bring out loopholes which might get missed.  Thirdly, applying the principles, each time a new one such as frameworks can foster structured thinking. The gaps can be analysed and improved upon.  Through all this we can master how we interact with gen AI. I learnt how we can use our intellect to create prompts. Getting output not just by random prompts but through vision and perspectives of thought leaders. And that can be done when we start thinking like one."
Suchhanda Dutta,"Reflection on Effective Communication and Better Prompting 25/03/2025 As I reflect on my experiences, I've come to realize that effective communication and better prompting are essential skills for success. To communicate effectively, I need to think more consultatively, considering the broader implications of my responses.  This means asking deeper questions, guiding conversations, and anticipating what's next. By doing so, I can provide more insightful and actionable advice.  Better prompting is also critical for effective communication. It requires clear direction, specific details, and a willingness to adapt and refine my prompts. By doing so, I can unlock more meaningful and relevant responses.  Curiosity and creativity are also essential for good prompting. By asking open-ended questions and using storytelling techniques, I can encourage more innovative and thoughtful responses.  Ultimately, effective communication and better prompting require patience, practice, and a willingness to learn and adapt. By developing these skills, I can build stronger relationships, drive more meaningful conversations, and achieve greater success."
Priyanshu Saxena,"*Reflection*  The document explains the importance of not just completing tasks but also adding value in a global consulting environment. It highlights that merely providing information is insufficient; consultants must understand their audience, think strategically, and communicate with clarity and depth.  A key takeaway is the importance of asking why something matters and how it affects various stakeholders, such as clients, business leaders, and international teams, rather than simply answering questions. The assessment also underscores the necessity of being proactive instead of reactive. This involves anticipating problems, understanding business goals, and guiding discussions to help clients make informed decisions.  To improve, the assessment suggests gaining exposure to different industries and cultures through case studies, mentorship, and cross-cultural training. It recommends using structured thinking techniques, like the Minto Pyramid Principle, to organize ideas clearly and logically. Additionally, developing a habit of reviewing one’s work, seeking feedback, and focusing on action-oriented communication can significantly enhance effectiveness."
Sarveshver,"Reflecting on ""better prompting""   It's crucial we understand how to prompt to gpt and the mistakes to avoid. While prompting it's better to write the prompt in the same manner we talk to our team members keeping all the stakeholders in mind and not to just give th problem statement to gpt and ask it solve it but also give directions as to how to solve it mentioning goals, insights and future prospects regarding it.  The conversation should not just be us giving straightforward answers to it but make it align with the business values and objectives.  Before talking to gpt it's important for us to fully understand the problem statement, the reason behind it and basically everything related to it and then proceed to talking to it and rigorously talk to it to continuously refine the conversation to achieve the desirable outcome.  We need to understand the impact this skill has on our and the company's reputation. We are a part of this company and also represent the environment and values it fosters. We need to enhance our knowledge data base in order to have the sense of how to give better prompts. Work and collaborate with people of higher understanding and knowledge to imbibe these in us. Continuously trying different methods with it and also sharing our learnings with others for better and collaborative growth and also continuously reflect on how we can improve ourselves and our prompting skills."
Darshna Adam,"25/03/2025 Reflection on Better Prompting  If I take a step back and look at how I have been engaging in conversations whether with AI, peers, or during work discussions  it becomes clear that my approach has often been immediate and outcome-driven. I tend to focus on getting quick answers rather than structuring my questions in a way that deepens understanding. This has led to moments where I receive surface-level responses, missing the opportunity to explore ideas more critically.  If I continue working this way, I will keep encountering gaps in my reasoning, limiting my ability to form well-thought-out perspectives. The way I ask questions directly influences the depth of insights I receive. Instead of just looking for instant solutions, I need to take a more structured approach one that encourages exploration rather than simple answers.  If I frame my prompts with context and a clear objective, the responses will align better with my needs. For instance, rather than asking, “How do I improve my leadership skills?” I can reframe it as, “If I were leading a team struggling with motivation, what strategies would help me align their goals with the organization's vision?” This approach encourages a broader perspective and generates more applicable insights.  If I build a habit of refining my questions, I will also develop a more consultative mindset. Instead of relying on minimal responses, I should actively analyze and adjust my prompts based on the responses I receive. This iterative process will help me think more critically and engage in meaningful discussions rather than just transactional exchanges.  If I incorporate storytelling into my questioning style, I will make my prompts more engaging and effective. If I consistently review and refine my prompts, I will improve not only my ability to communicate with AI but also my strategic thinking in real-world situations. Regular exposure to case studies, consulting frameworks, and structured discussions will further enhance my ability to frame thought-provoking questions.  By shifting from a reactive to a reflective and structured approach, I can turn every interaction whether with AI, colleagues, or during brainstorming sessions into an opportunity for deeper exploration and learning. <This message was edited>"
Artuha Paul,"*25/03/25: Reflection around mindful prompting-* 1- Understanding the gaps : How does limited exposure effect the way we prompt ? Why do we tend to question less why prompting to ChatGPT and take the very first output ? Why is ""understanding the why"" of the process important?  A few things we usually miss while writing prompts is to be able to understand why this certain process or structure is being followed to generate the output, how is the output connected to each of these steps, and we usually follow the transactional approach (do this, do that) rather than a consultative (Play a Bain consultant ) approach. We also make one mistake around prompting, which is, not asking and inquiring the ""why or how"" questions enough while prompting Gen AI which them leads to surface level outcomes for us.  Why does the Gap matter: While working with multiple client organisation, the idea is to have more a strategic point of view, rather than a narrower one while representing DT at a client organisation, Consultants are usually expected to grasp things quickly and drive execution for different organisations.  Closing the gap: How do we approach this gap that exists? How do we work towards closing this gap?  1- Having a strategic and consultative mindset: Usage of ""why"" and ""so what"", 1- why is this important? Why is this a problem? 2- So what do we do to solve this problem? So what happens when we solve this problem?  Understanding and stating what the desired outcome and result is, while outlining the approach that we would want to take, would help with Gen AI, since this would define the entire structure (a workflow at the beginning)  Using structured frameworks, like Minto Pyramid Principle (situation, complication, question, answer) to create a clear understanding of what is the output we are expecting from the exercise even before using Gen AI.    2- Using workshops as a way: Learning and conducting workshops with ideas in which we have little understanding, this helps us expand our knowledge the set of boundaries that we have set for ourselves."
Aishani Rachakonda,"25/03/2025 - Reflection - Better Prompting  The quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the response. Simple and vague prompts often lead to generic, surface-level answers. When we give AI a minimal prompt, we are essentially limiting its potential. The AI can only work with the information we provide, which means that if we want richer, more insightful, and more structured responses, we need to craft our prompts more thoughtfully.  A well-designed prompt should include context, purpose, and a clear expectation. If we are too broad, AI may generate something that lacks relevance or depth. On the other hand, if we guide it with structured, detailed prompts, it can produce responses that are aligned with our needs, whether it be consulting insights, strategic recommendations, or critical analysis. This is why global consultants or anyone working in a high-level role must approach AI with a mindset of strategic questioning rather than just seeking quick answers.  One effective method to improve AI-generated content is role playing. By specifying the role we want AI to take, whether it’s a senior consultant, a market analyst, or an expert in a particular field, we guide it toward a more refined and targeted response. This simple technique has dramatically improved the quality of AI-driven outputs. When AI understands the context, it generates responses that are more aligned with real-world applications.  The ability to ask the right questions is just as valuable as the ability to find the right answers. AI is a powerful tool, but it relies entirely on how we use it. If we treat it as a passive information provider, it will only deliver generic results. However, if we engage with it in a structured and consultative manner, we can extract much more profound insights.  Ultimately, improving our prompting skills is not just about getting better AI responses; it’s about refining our own thought process. Being intentional with our prompts encourages structured thinking, better articulation of ideas, and a consultative approach that aligns with global professional standards. By consistently applying these principles, we can maximize the potential of AI and enhance our own analytical and strategic skills."
Sanjivani Sinha,"*Reflection*                                                                 Reading this document made me rethink my approach to prompting. I used to believe that giving a clear, step-by-step structure was enough, yet I often find that AI either misinterprets my intent or delivers something too shallow. This made me wonder why isn’t clarity alone enough? One thing that stood out to me was the idea that my prompts might be too transactional. I tell the AI what to do, but I don’t always engage with it in a way that guides the process. The document mentions a consultative approach, and I realized that’s what I’ve been missing. I’ve been treating AI like a tool that should just execute instructions, rather than a partner that I should refine my thinking with. If I were working with a human expert, I wouldn’t just hand them a checklist, I’d discuss, clarify, and make sure we’re aligned. Why am I not doing that with AI?  I also noticed that when AI doesn’t get something right, my instinct is often to rephrase the same request rather than ask AI why it got it wrong in the first place. This connects to what the document says about underutilizing inquiry, I haven’t been asking AI to analyze its own responses. Instead of just repeating my request differently, I could ask: What part of my instruction was unclear? What assumptions did you make while generating that answer? I should try to use the Socratic method more, instead of just feeding AI answers, I should be prompting it to question itself. If AI misunderstands, I don’t just need better instruction; I need a better dialogue with it.  The document also made me reflect on the broader perspective of my prompts. Sometimes I focus too much on just getting an answer instead of considering how the AI is processing the information. When I ask it to play a role, I might not be providing enough context, framing, or audience perspective. This explains why some responses feel generic, they lack the depth that would come from a properly framed question.  I want to change a few things after going through this, instead of just giving step-by-step instructions and expecting perfect execution, I’ll start treating my prompts more like a conversation, checking for understanding, refining as I go, and encouraging AI to analyze its own responses. If I can shift from just asking for answers to guiding a thought process, I’ll probably get results that feel a lot more intentional and useful. <This message was edited>"
Anay Pund,"*Reflection* Reading this docs made me realize how important it is to think beyond just completing a task. Before, my focus was mostly on giving quick, direct answers without considering how different people like clients from different cultures or senior leaders might see things. We definitely want to add various perspectives to enhance our thinking and SDP.  I used to prompt in a very transactional way, just sharing information without really guiding the conversation or thinking about the bigger picture. Consulting isn’t just about giving information; it's about helping people understand why something matters and what they should do next. Thus answering ""Why"" becomes very important. Getting this answer generated by GenAI will add on one more perspective and train the LLM further for our specific purpose.  Main takeaways is the importance of asking deeper questions. Instead of just explaining a process, I can ask myself, “Why is this important for the client?” or “How would people from different cultures respond to this idea?” This small shift helps me communicate in a more meaningful way, which builds trust and confidence.  I also appreciate the suggestions provided, like learning from case studies to get the idea of role playing expertise, attending workshops to explore ideas or shadowing experienced consultants or expert prompt writers.  Moving forward, I'm excited to try more structured ways of thinking, like clearly stating the goal or recommended next steps in my communication. I also want to get into the habit of regularly reviewing my own work and asking peers for feedback, I will definitely take out some time for this. Doing this consistently will help me keep improving."
Syeda Fatima Raza,"*Reflection* 25/03/25  After reading the Better Mindset, Better Prompting document I realize both the strengths and gaps in my current way of approaching things. One thing that I think is important for improving leadership is the consultative mindset.  As DT interns, we tend to focus on how our work impacts a diverse range of people and the effective ways to communicate it. But there's always room for improvement. One baby step we all can take to improve is enhancing our approach to questioning.  It is also important to pay attention to mentorship and feedbacks. We do team sessions in ART Lab where we appreciate and give feedback to each other, but we could improve these discussions by using Minto Pyramid Principle to enhance the quality of discussions making them more impactful.  For me I can start with self reviewing my communication."
Janhavi Shukla,"*Reflection* ~ One of my biggest takeaways from this assessment is the importance of continuous reflection. It’s easy to focus on completing a task and moving on, but the real learning happens when I take a step back and analyze how things can be improved. Every prompt, response, and interaction is a chance to refine my thinking. If I don’t pause to evaluate, I might miss patterns or insights that could significantly enhance my approach.  One pattern I noticed is how my prompting style affects the output quality. There have been times when I thought my instructions were clear, yet the AI responded in a way I didn’t expect. Initially, I would just reword the prompt slightly and try again, but this assessment made me realize I should be asking why the AI responded that way in the first place. What assumptions did it make? Where was the gap in my instruction? Treating AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool can lead to more refined and insightful responses.  Something I hadn’t actively considered before is how prompting influences long-term learning. When AI generates responses, it isn’t just about getting an answer—it’s also about training myself to ask better questions. I experimented with using different prompts for the same task and was surprised by how much the responses varied. This made me realize that even small tweaks in phrasing can shape the direction of the output. Instead of passively accepting answers, I want to make it a habit to analyze how the AI arrived at a response and what I can adjust to make the interaction more effective.  Moving forward, I want to shift from just ""giving instructions"" to structuring prompts in a way that encourages exploration and discussion. I also plan to spend time identifying key frameworks and principles that can make my prompting more strategic. Additionally, I want to challenge AI’s responses more by asking Socratic questions instead of just accepting outputs at face value.  This assessment reinforced how valuable continuous reflection is—not just for improving AI interactions, but for shaping a more structured and intentional way of thinking overall. The more I iterate on my approach and seek feedback, the better I can refine my skills in both prompting and critical analysis. <This message was edited>"
Sandeep Singh Kaintura,"*Reflection*  The document dives into the problem faced by the people who don’t see the depth of things and how one can become better at prompting as well as improve his thinking. I believe , when we are trying to work on a project, we tend to play it safe, as we dont want to make mistakes. To tackle this prompt issue, I believe one should be able to play, be able to take risks and get into that zone, where making mistakes is not a burden, but a way to be creative.  The problems mentioned in this are stemming from this inability to take risks(in my opinion) , which can stem from either not having depth and clarity about the project or the mindset of the person.  The document also talks about transactional prompting , which I believe is something I do as well. Not giving clear directions to the AI to make good output. Also just getting the bare minimum from the chatgpt and not exploring the variety of responses AI can present.  The solution mentions having more breadth in your knowledge space, which is through reading a lot. Asking questions which helps you understand the depth of things, having multiple perspectives to gain more insights. As a consultant, one must be a guide and a guide who has not seen the land himself , is not a good guide. As a consultant, one solves problems of the organization . And to solve problems one must be logical, creative and knowledgeable. I would say, the AI is the best tool and as I move forward, I would like to play more with the AI prompts and workflow. The goal is not to give the best prompt, the goal is to give 100 good/bad prompts and improve on them.  The strategic point of view is also important, as you have to see the bigger picture, you have to have that depth as well as the eagle view, to make prompts so that AI understands your problem in a better way. If we give the task we are doing and not background. It might backfire as the output might not be aligned with the unknown inputs not given to AI. To have that overview and to then experiment with AI, will make the thinking go into a level of a decision maker gradually.  Reflecting and feedback on the prompts helps as it shows you the mistakes you are making and ways one can improve."
Swastika Bhagat,"My reflection on (Better Mindset Better Prompting)  Effective communication and strategic prompting are essential for unlocking deeper insights and driving impactful interactions. The way we frame our questions directly shapes the depth and relevance of the responses we receive, whether from AI or in human conversations. Simple, vague prompts often lead to generic answers, while well-structured prompts—those that provide context, purpose, and clear expectations—enable more insightful and actionable outcomes. A consultative mindset helps us think critically, ask deeper questions, and guide discussions toward meaningful insights. One effective technique for improving AI-generated responses is role-playing, where we assign a specific perspective (e.g., a consultant or industry expert) to generate more refined, contextually relevant outputs.  Beyond structured questioning, curiosity and creativity play a crucial role in effective prompting. Open-ended questions, storytelling techniques, and real-world scenarios encourage more thoughtful and engaging discussions. A structured yet adaptable approach ensures that responses are both relevant and thought-provoking. Ultimately, mastering communication and prompting is a continuous learning process requiring patience, practice, and refinement. By engaging with AI and people in a structured yet dynamic way, we not only enhance the quality of responses but also strengthen our critical thinking, build stronger relationships, and foster meaningful conversations that drive professional and personal success."
